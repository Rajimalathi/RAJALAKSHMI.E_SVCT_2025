# - 12:00:00PM on a 12-hour clock is 12:00:00 on a 24-hour clock.

# Example


# Return '12:01:00'.


# Return '00:01:00'.

# Function Description

# Complete the timeConversion function in the editor below. It should return a new string representing the input time in 24 hour format.

# timeConversion has the following parameter(s):

# string s: a time in 12  hour format
# Returns

# string: the time in 24 hour format
# Input Format

# A single string  that represents a time in -hour clock format (i.e.:  or ).

# Constraints

# All input times are valid
# Sample Input 0

    hours, minutes, seconds_ampm = map(int, s[:-2].split(':'))

    # Check if it is AM and 12 AM, then set hours to 0
    elif "AM" in s and hours == 12:
        hours = 0
    
    # Format the result as a string in 24-hour format
    result = f"{hours:02d}:{minutes:02d}:{seconds_ampm:02d}"
